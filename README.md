### Grading rules

The course provides two forms of knowledge control:

* Practical homeworks in Jupyter Notebook format
* Written exam

The final grade is formulated as follows:

Course_Grade $= 0.6 \times HW_{w.a.} + 0.4 \times Exam$,

where $HW_{w.a.}$ is defined as weighted average of all homeworks, i.e.:\
**- formula for homeworks will appear here ASAP**

Grade rounding is performed according to standard rules: 
- $3.5=4$ 
- $3.49=3$

### Rules for submitting assignments

The **SOFT** deadline for each homework is either 1 week or 2 weeks, which will be specified for each homework.\
The **HARD** deadline is in a week after the **SOFT** deadline.\
One point will be deducted from the homework grade for each day of delay between **SOFT** and **HARD** deadlines.

You can submit your homework only as an `.ipynb` file.

After each section, question or assignment, there is a label with the maximum points you can earn. The maximum score for HW is 10, but you **don't** have to do everything. Remember, in HSE 8 is also an excellent result.

If there is any code present in a cell, remember that it's just a recommendation. Feel free to write your own implementation that does the same, or follow hints that we left for you.

If you copy your friend's answers, that's bad, but we can't reliably control it. At the very least understand each line of code and retype it yourself with a different structure. **Direct or naive plagiarism will be punished according to the HSE rules.**

The use of generative LLM models is authorized on the following conditions:

1. Specify which parts of the homework were completed with the help of generative models.

2. Add a small reflection section at the end of your solution, where you describe how you selected the prompts, what advantages and disadvantages of generative models you noticed when performing this task.

In any case, we reserve the right to invite the student to defend his/her assignment if we suspect plagiarism.
